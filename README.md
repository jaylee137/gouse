## 📝 Why Gouse?

- Gouse is a modern [Golang](https://golang.org/) utility package delivering consistency, modularity, performance, & extras.
- Preset functions inspired by [Lodash.js](https://lodash.com/).
- Gouse provides a wide variety of methods, taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
- Each method has a different set of features, so you can pick the ones that fit your project best.
- Easy to use, chainable, and extendable, and available in a variety of builds & module formats.
- Utility functions are available to handle complex logic. Operations such as database connection, build APIs, error handling, log management... can all be set up quickly and easily

## ✨ Motivation

- Go has emerged as a server language, but it still doesn't have complete and consistent packages available to support coding development.

- To address that need, Gouse was created as a powerful toolkit for Go developers, a collection of built-in functions and best practices that provide comprehensive, powerful, and reliable solutions. Trusted to build services, APIs, and web applications.
